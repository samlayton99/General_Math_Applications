# Fourier Transform Project Description

The Fourier transform is a powerful mathematical tool that allows us to transform and analyze signals in terms of their constituent frequencies. Its importance spans across fields like engineering, physics, and digital signal processing. This project dives deep into the application of the Fourier transform, particularly focusing on sound waves. Central to this project are the classes `PeriodicSampling` and `SoundWave`.

## Mathematical Background and Overview of Functions

The Fourier transform offers a method to express a time-domain signal in the frequency domain. By converting a signal into its sine and cosine components, we gain insight into its frequency characteristics. Every frequency component has an associated Fourier coefficient, and the transform efficiently computes these coefficients.

1. **PeriodicSampling**
    - `PeriodicSampling(f, n, T, v)`: This method samples a function at regular intervals. After sampling, it extracts the frequency components, which are used to generate the Fourier series representation of the original function. This process helps in analyzing the primary frequencies and their amplitudes.
    - `plot()`: This method goes beyond mere calculations. It visually contrasts the original function with its Fourier series approximation, offering a graphical insight into how close the approximation is to the original signal.

2. **SoundWave**
    - `SoundWave(sample_rate, array_samples)`: Represents sound waves in terms of discrete samples. The higher the sample rate, the more accurate the representation.
    - `play()`: Brings the sound wave to life by playing it. Useful for auditory verification after processing.
    - `plot()`: Allows users to visually inspect the waveform, making it easy to identify peaks, troughs, and other features.
    - `normalize()`: Ensures that the amplitude of the sound wave does not exceed a specified level, preventing distortion.
    - `fade_in()` & `fade_out()`: These methods help in achieving smooth beginnings and endings to sound clips by gradually increasing or decreasing the volume.
    - `reverse()`: Plays the sound samples in reverse order, creating a unique effect.
    - `concatenate()`: Stitch together two sound waves to create a longer, continuous wave.
    - `mix()`: Overlays two sound waves, which can be used to create layered audio effects.
    - `fourier_transform()`: A crucial method that applies the Fourier transform to the sound wave, extracting the frequency components.
    - `spectrogram()`: A powerful visualization tool, it provides a heat map of how frequencies change over time in a sound wave, making it essential for detailed analysis.
